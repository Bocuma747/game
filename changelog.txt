0.6.2
You Got a Purdy Map
    Saul Rennison's Dynamic RTT Shadows - More accurate shadows cast by world lights
    Brian Charles' Parallax-Corrected Cubemaps - More accurate reflections for cubemaps on world geometry
    (Both of these can be found in live examples in the triggertests map!)
    
Small Features Added
    Disabled inputs - The keypress HUD element now shows disabled keys set by triggers
    Invalid run start - A sound now plays if the run cannot be started (will be expanded upon)
    Checkpoint saving - Maps save which checkpoint you were on when you end the map
    mom_punchangle_enable - Landing punchangle has been disabled by default now, can be scaled by this cvar
    mom_speedometer_colorize 2 - New colorization method suggested by Acta
    mom_stage_tele - Teleport to the start of a specific stage number (1 = start)
    showRuler - Shows a menu to measure distance in-game (in units)
    sv_gravity - Allow players to change gravity in-game
    sv_tickrate - In-game changes force a reload, allowing replays of different tickrate to be played
    
RIP Tim, You Shall Be Missed
    .tim files are completely removed, in favor of reading replay files
    (This means all replays prior to this update will be ignored due to a new format)
    
Yet to Come
